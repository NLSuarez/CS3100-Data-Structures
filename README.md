# C-Code-Examples
Projects done in my Data Structures Course at CSU Stanislaus

There are 5 projects in this repository. Each will have an individual readme file for compiling. The server I ran these on was assumed to have the latest version of C++ on it as of 2015. Each was run on a mac machine that could dual boot Windows.

|Program 1: Expression Checker

|Program 2: Sorting algorithms

|Program 3: Primitive Criminal Database(uses a text file rather than SQL)

|Program 4: Heap and Priority Queues

|Program 5: Table Hash with External Chaining
